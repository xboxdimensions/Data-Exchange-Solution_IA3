# Data-Exchange-Solution_IA3

A data exchange solution that gets data from the following API:
https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json?limit=1000&sort=report_date:desc

I put that into a database and display it on a website. 
The database thing is kind of redundant but it saves cost from requesting it from the API every single time.
However, I have a login system which hashes user passwords.
